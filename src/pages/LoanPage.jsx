    <p>A loan is a financial agreement  between a lender and a borrower, 
      where the borrower is given a sum of moneyâ€”the principalâ€”and must pay it back over time. 
      Loans are among the most popular methods people and companies borrow money, 
      and they are typically classified into three general categories: </p>
      <p className="mt-2"><strong className="text-xl text-blue-900">An amortized loan </strong> is a loan that you repay with set, regular payments until the loan matures.</p>

                    <p>
                      An <strong>Amortized Loan</strong> is one of the most common types of loans, where borrowers pay back the loan in equal
                      installments over time. Each payment you make is split into two parts:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                      <li><strong>Principal</strong> (the amount you borrowed)</li>
                      <li><strong>Interest</strong> (the cost of borrowing)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className="mt-2">
                      This type of loan is widely used for <em>mortgages, car loans, and personal loans</em> because it gives predictable monthly
                      payments, helping borrowers plan their finances with confidence.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-5">How Amortized Loans Work</h2>
                    <p>
                      Amortization means the loan is gradually paid down with regular payments until the balance reaches zero.
                    </p>

                    <p className="mt-3 font-medium">The formula for calculating the monthly payment is:</p>

                    <div className="bg-gray-50 border border-gray-100 p-4 rounded-md my-3">
                      {/* Render the formula as plain LaTeX-like text */}
                      <pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
                        {`M = (P Ã— r Ã— (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n âˆ’ 1)`}

                        Where:
                        â€¢ M = Monthly Payment
                        â€¢ P = Loan Amount (Principal)
                        â€¢ r = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate Ã· 12)
                        â€¢ n = Total Number of Payments (Loan Term in Months)

                      </pre>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Tip:</strong> With each payment, the interest portion decreases while the principal portion increases. By the end of the
                      loan term, most of your payments go toward principal instead of interest.

                        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">What is an amortized loan?</h3>
                        <p>An amortized loan is a loan repaid through regular installments that cover both principal and interest until it is fully paid off.</p>
                      </div>

                      <div>
                        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Why does the interest portion decrease over time?</h3>
                        <p>Because interest is calculated on the remaining balance, as the principal reduces, less interest is charged.</p>
                      </div>

                        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Are all mortgages amortized loans?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, most fixed-rate mortgages are amortized, meaning equal monthly payments over the term. However, some loans like interest-only mortgages are not amortized in the early years.</p>
                      </div>

                      <div>
                        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Is it better to choose a shorter amortization period?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. A shorter term means higher monthly payments but much less total interest paid over the life of the loan.</p>
                      </div>

                      <div>
                        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Can I pay off an amortized loan early?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. Making extra payments reduces the principal faster, lowering interest costs and shortening the loan term.</p>

                <p>
                  A <strong>Deferred Payment Loan</strong> allows the borrower to delay
                  all payments until the end of the loan term. Instead of making regular
                  installments, the borrower repays a <em>lump sum</em> that includes
                  both the original loan amount and the accumulated interest at
                  maturity.{" "}

                  How Deferred Payment Loans Work
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Since no payments are made until maturity, the loan balance grows due
                  to compounding interest. At the end of the loan term, the borrower
                  pays back the entire balance in one payment.
                </p>

                <p className="mt-2 font-medium">The formula for the lump sum is:</p>

                <div className="bg-gray-50 border border-gray-100 px-4 rounded-md my-2">
                  <pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
        {`A = P Ã— (1 + r/n)^(n Ã— t)`}

        Where:
        â€¢ A = Amount due at maturity
        â€¢ P = Loan Amount (Principal)
        â€¢ r = Annual Interest Rate
        â€¢ n = Number of compounding periods per year
        â€¢ t = Loan Term in years
        
                  </pre>
                </div>

                <p>
                  ðŸ‘‰ The borrower benefits from deferred payments during the loan term,
                  but the final repayment is usually much larger because of accumulated
                  interest.

                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">What is a deferred payment loan?</h3>
                    <p>
                      It is a loan where no payments are made during the loan term, and the borrower repays a lump sum (principal + interest) at maturity.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div>

                    <p>
                      Not usually. While they provide flexibility, deferred loans typically cost more in total interest compared to amortized loans.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Are deferred loans risky?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Yes, because the lump sum can be large. Borrowers must plan carefully to ensure they can repay at maturity.
                    </p>

              <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                A Bond Loan, or a loan with a predetermined due amount, is structured
                so that the borrower repays a lump sum at maturity instead of making
                equal installments over time. These types of loans are often used in
                bonds, zero-coupon bonds, and corporate debt financing, where the
                investor or lender receives the full repayment along with interest at
                the end of the loan term.

              <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                Unlike amortized or deferred loans, bond loans donâ€™t require monthly
                payments. Instead, the borrower agrees to pay back a predetermined
                amount (the maturity value) at the end of the term. The present value
                of the loan is calculated based on interest rate and compounding.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">The formula is:</p>
              <p className="italic mt-2 text-gray-700">
                P = F Ã· (1 + r)<sup>n</sup>
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                Where: <br />
                P = Present Value (Loan Amount) <br />
                F = Future Value (Predetermined Due Amount at maturity) <br />
                r = Interest Rate per period <br />
                n = Number of compounding periods
