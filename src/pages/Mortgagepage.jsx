              <p>
                A mortgage calculator is a digital financial planning tool that provides a
                quick estimate of your loan repayment schedule. It calculates your monthly
                payments based on the loan principal, interest rate, and repayment term. The
                calculator can also show an amortization table, which splits each payment
                into interest and principal portions, helping you understand how your loan
                balance decreases over time.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900">Mortgage Payment Formula</h2>
              <p>The formula used to calculate a fixed-rate mortgage payment is:</p>
              <p className="bg-gray-100 p-3 rounded font-mono">
                M = P Ã— [ r(1 + r)<sup>n</sup> ] Ã· [ (1 + r)<sup>n</sup> â€“ 1 ]
              </p>
              <p>Where:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                <li><strong>M</strong> = Monthly payment</li>
                <li><strong>P</strong> = Loan principal (amount borrowed)</li>
                <li><strong>r</strong> = Monthly interest rate (annual rate Ã· 12)</li>
                <li><strong>n</strong> = Total number of monthly payments (loan term Ã— 12)</li>

              <p>
                Suppose you take out a home loan of <strong>$200,000</strong> with a fixed
                annual interest rate of <strong>6%</strong> for <strong>30 years</strong>.
